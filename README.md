# Alzheimer-Disease-Detection
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of uncertain cause and pathogenesis that primarily affects older adults and is the most common cause of dementia. The earliest clinical manifestation of AD is selective memory impairment and while treatments are available to ameliorate some symptoms, there is no cure currently available. Brain Imaging via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is used for evaluation of patients with suspected AD. MRI findings include both, local and generalized shrinkage of brain tissue. Below is a pictorial representation of tissue shrinkage:braintissue Some studies have suggested that MRI features may predict rate of decline of AD and may guide therapy in the future. However in order to reach that stage clinicians and researchers will have to make use of machine learning techniques that can accurately predict progress of a patient from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. We propose to develop a sound model that can help clinicians do that and predict early alzheimer's.
